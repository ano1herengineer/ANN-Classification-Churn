    "### ANN Project Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict whether a person will leave the bank or not using the Churn Modelling Dataset. The implementation involves several key steps, including data preprocessing, model creation, training, and saving the trained model for deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Learning Frameworks\n",
    "- **PyTorch** or **TensorFlow**: These are the primary frameworks used for building and training neural networks.\n",
    "- **Keras**: Used as an API within TensorFlow for easier model building.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Data Preprocessing\n",
    "- **Loading Data**: Load the Churn Modelling Dataset.\n",
    "- **Feature Engineering**: Convert categorical variables into numerical values using techniques like one-hot encoding.\n",
    "- **Standardization**: Normalize the data to ensure all features contribute equally to the model. This can be done using StandardScaler from sklearn.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Creating the ANN\n",
    "- **Sequential Model**: The ANN is built using TensorFlow's Sequential model.\n",
    "- **Layers**:\n",
    "  - **Input Layer**: The first layer that receives the input data.\n",
    "  - **Dense Layers**: Fully connected layers with 64 nodes.\n",
    "  - **Activation Functions**: Various activation functions like Sigmoid, Tanh, ReLU, and Leaky ReLU are used to introduce non-linearity.\n",
    "  - **Dropout**: Applied to prevent overfitting by randomly setting a fraction of input units to 0 at each update during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Compiling the Model\n",
    "- **Optimizers**: Used for backpropagation and updating weights. Examples include Adam, SGD, etc.\n",
    "- **Loss Function**: Measures the difference between the predicted and actual values. For binary classification, binary_crossentropy is commonly used.\n",
    "- **Metrics**: Used to evaluate the model's performance, such as accuracy, mean squared error (MSE), and mean absolute error (MAE).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Training the Model\n",
    "- **Training Process**: Fit the model to the training data, specifying the number of epochs and batch size.\n",
    "- **Validation**: Use a validation set to monitor the model's performance on unseen data.\n",
    "- **Training Information**: Logs and visualizations are generated using TensorBoard to monitor the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Saving the Model\n",
    "- **Pickle Files**: The trained model is saved in a pickle file format or `.h5` format for deployment.\n",
    "- **Deployment**: The saved model can be deployed to Streamlit Cloud for making predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important Parameters for ANN (TensorFlow -> Sequential Model)\n",
    "1. **Sequential Network**: A linear stack of layers.\n",
    "2. **Dense 64 Nodes**: Fully connected layers with 64 neurons.\n",
    "3. **Activation Functions**: Sigmoid, Tanh, ReLU, Leaky ReLU.\n",
    "4. **Optimizers**: Algorithms for updating weights during training.\n",
    "5. **Loss Function**: Function to minimize during training.\n",
    "6. **Metrics**: Accuracy, MSE, MAE.\n",
    "7. **Training Info**: Logs and visualizations using TensorBoard.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Import Libraries\n",
    "- Import necessary libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, pandas, numpy, and sklearn.\n",
